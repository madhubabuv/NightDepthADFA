# NightDepthADFA
Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation for Night-time Images using Adversarial Domain Feature Adaptation

Apologies for the delay in releasing the model. Due to some issues, I no longer have access to the codebase I used while writing this paper. I am reimplementing it again and the trained models and evaluation scripts will be made available soon.
